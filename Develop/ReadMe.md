## Project Description:

ReadMeUpScotty is a terminal bases generator that allows our users to easily and quickly generate a readme file using their intergrated terminal and node.js.
Tired of writing readme's? This command line application will take your input and generate a simple formatted readme from which you can change and build on over and over, which in turn allows the project creator to devote more time to working on other aspects of the project.
